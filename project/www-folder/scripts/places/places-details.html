            <p>Spread in ribbons over a steep mountain ridge, surrounded by emerald-green tea plantations and towered over by the majestic Khanchendzonga (8598m), Darjeeling is the definitive Indian hill station. Dating back to the Raj era, it's arguably West Bengal’s premier attraction, and promises some interesting exploration for the curious traveller. When you aren’t gazing open-mouthed at Khanchendzonga, you can explore colonial-era architecture, visit Buddhist monasteries, and spot snow leopards and red pandas at the nearby zoo. On the steep and bustling streets winding through town, you can lose yourself amid an array of Himalayan faces from Sikkim, Bhutan, Nepal and Tibet. And finally, when energies start to flag, a good, steaming Darjeeling brew is never far away.</p>

            <p>Kurseong, 32km south of Darjeeling, is a tiny and bustling hill town best known for its formidable league of tea estates and a rush of Raj-era boarding schools that dot its extents. Its name derives from the Lepcha word khorsang, a reference to the small white orchid prolific in this area.

            <p align="center" style="font-size:22px;"><strong style="color:#FF0000;">Street Food of Kolkata</strong></p>
            <p>KOLKATA: If it is street food you are looking for, Kolkata is the place to be. Once the city of just jhal muri (puffed rice mixed with other ingredients), phuchka (golgappa), singara (samosa), kachauri and telebhaja (oil fries), street food graduated to hot kathi rolls (kebabs rolled in a paratha) and mughlai paratha (paratha with potato filling laced with egg) in the 1960s. Sometime during the 1980s, chowmein (mixed noodles) turned into a favorite street food with kiosks and carts mushrooming in nearly every locality. Around that time, Kolkata adopted paw bhaji, a favourite Maharashtrian dish that is extremely popular in Mumbai. We design this tour with your gastronomical desires in mind. This tour is fully customized based on what you would like to try. We are quite particular about what we eat, so the places we go to are hand-picked by us after rigorous selection. As we sample great food, we will talk about traditional cooking methods; ingredients and maybe you can learn a dish or two to impress your friends! If you are a foodie, you just cannot miss this experience. You can opt for lunch or dinner or even both, if there is enough space in your stomach!</p>

It is practiced from the individual level in a garden up to the activities of a multinational corporation. It is very diverse in its activities, incorporating plants for food (fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, culinary herbs) and non-food crops (flowers, trees and shrubs, turf-grass, hops, medicinal herbs). It also includes related services in plant conservation, landscape restoration, landscape and garden design/construction/maintenance, arboriculture, horticultural therapy, and much more.
